# This is the main controller of the Databrowser.
# We try to "Wrap" all api requests in this one single point
# and do some clever work with filters and routing to make this work.
# The basic flow goes like this:
# * The Api request is routed as parameters to this controller
# * The set_url field deals with that parameter as well as search parameters
# * The show action creates the new model with the url, searches, and pages.
# We make heavy use of params which is everything that comes into
# this controller after /entities/
class EntitiesController < ApplicationController
  before_filter :set_url

  # What we see mostly here is that we are looking for searh parameters.
  # Now, we also try to simply set up the search field and then remove it
  # from the parameters so that we don't confuse the API by passing it
  # through later.
  #
  # Here we tell the Entity model that it's url is the thing that was passed
  # through in params. Which is how we are able to wrap the entire
  # api through one place.
  def set_url
    @search_field = nil
    case params[:search_type]
    when /students/
      @search_field = "studentUniqueStateId"
    when /staff/
      @search_field = "staffUniqueStateId"
    when /parents/
      @search_field = "parentUniqueStateId"
    when /educationOrganizations/
      @search_field = "stateOrganizationId"
    end

    Entity.url_type = params[:other]
    params.delete(:search_type)
    Entity.format = ActiveResource::Formats::JsonLinkFormat
  end

  # Ignoring some of the complicated parts, is we use the configured
  # model from set_url to make the Api call to get the data from the Api.
  #
  # Because we are trying to be generic with the data we get back, we handle
  # two special cases. The first is if params is 'home' which is a 
  # special home page in the Api. So if we call that we, render the index
  # page instead of the normal 'show'.
  # 
  # Second, if we only got one entity back, like the data for a single student
  # we go ahead and wrap that up into an array with that as the only element so
  # that our view logic can be simpler.
  #
  # As for the complicated parts, we do a few things, first is we detect if we
  # were passed any search parameters, and augment the Api call to deal with that
  # instead.
  #
  # Second, if we see any offset in params then we make the call to
  # grab the next page of data from the Api.
