			The Assessment domain defines a model that can be used for a wide

			<epilog xml:lang="en">Many states have standard learning
				standards that drive the curriculum and the assessments. The Common
				Core State Standards Initiative
				(www.corestandards.org) is a national
				initiative for standards in this area. For states that use the
				Common Core, or have their own standards, the assessment model has
				entities
				for LearningStandard, which represents
				the lowest level of
				skills, and LearningObjective, which represents higher level
				aggregation of skills, as shown below. The model supports

			<epilog xml:lang="en">
				Assessment metadata is defined as all data that describes the
				assessment, as shown below. The model reflects four levels of
				definition,
				designed to accommodate a wide variety of
				assessment
				reporting, as follows:
				<ul>
					<li>AssessmentFamily – optional identification for a family of
						tests. For example, a family of statewide tests might be
						identified relating different subject assessments at
						different
						grade level. If required, AssessmentFamilies may be hierarchically
						organized. By convention, characteristics of an AssessmentFamily
						should be “inherited” by the
						individual Assessments.
					</li>
					<li>Assessment – represents a specific assessment. The Assessment
						entity contains the minimum amount of metadata required for an
						assessment.
					</li>
					<li>ObjectiveAssessment – optional identification of portions of
						the assessment that test specific learning objectives. If
						required, there can be multiple levels of
						hierarchical
						ObjectiveAssessments.
					</li>
					<li>AssessmentItem – optional identification of the individual
						questions or items on a test to be scored.
					</li>
				</ul>
				Note that if the assessment references state standards for
				LearningStandards and LearningObjectives, then the assessment
				metadata would reference the preloaded standards. If
				the
				assessment
				references its own set of LearningObjectives and/or
				LearningStandards, then that data would be loaded as assessment
				metadata. An ObjectiveAssessment may test one
				or
				more
				LearningObjectives, and/or may test one or more LearningStandards.

		<title>Bell Schedule</title>
		<description xml:lang="en">
			The BellSchedule represents the pattern of class period scheduling in
			a day or over a course of days. The model is meant to accommodate a
			wide variety of bell schedules
			including block schedules, as follows:
			<ul>
				<li>Sections are assigned a “logical” ClassPeriod which forms the
					basis for scheduling that section.
				</li>
				<li>A BellSchedule defines the MeetingTimes (time of day on which
					days of the week) for each logical ClassPeriod. ClassPeriod do not
					have to meet every day. The pattern of the
					BellSchedule may span any
					number of weeks, as indicated by the WeeksInCycle attribute.
				</li>
				<li>The association between BellSchedule and CalendarDate indicates
					which days of the Session, the BellSchedule was in effect. This
					allows the school to have BellSchedule that
					are special for a
					specific day, such as for a testing day, or a late-start day.
				</li>
				<li>A School may have multiple BellSchedules defined, and may have

			The discipline domain model is fundamentally based the following
			major entities:
			<ul>
				<li>DisciplineIncident – represent the actions or behaviors that
					constitute an “offense” in violation of laws, rules, policies, or
					norms of behavior.
				</li>
				<li>StudentDisciplineIncidentAssociation – links students to
					DisciplineIncidents and indicates their role in that incident.
				</li>
				<li>DisciplineAction – represents the punitive or other actions
					taken against the students.
				</li>
			</ul>
			The model supports several flexibilities, as follows:
			<ul>
				<li>The BehaviorDescriptor holds the custom classification of
					discipline incidents for a School.
				</li>
				<li>The DisciplineDescriptor holds the custom classification of
					discipline actions for a School.
				</li>
				<li>When multiple students are involved in a DisciplineIncident, the
					optional association from the StudentDisciplineIncidentAssociation
					to the BehaviorDescriptor may be used
					when students have different
					levels of involvement, and therefore different offenses, for the
					same discipline incident (e.g., one might be the perpetrator and
					one might be an
					accomplice).
				</li>
				<li>One DisciplineAction may be applied to one or more
					DisciplineIncidents (e.g., one suspension for multiple occurrences
					of fighting).
				</li>
				<li>One or more DisciplineActions may be applied to one
					DisciplineIncident (e.g., suspension plus after school study hall).
					Alternatively, one DisciplineAction could have
					multiple
					DisciplineDescriptors associated with it to accomplish the same
					thing.
