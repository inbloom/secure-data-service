Background:
SFTP into landing zone to drop the Small Data Set

Given I am using local data store
# put the small sample dataset into the landing zone 
Given I am using default landing zone
Given I use the landingzone user name "testuser0.wgen@gmail.com" and password "test1234" on landingzone server "picard-lz.slidev.org" on port "443"
And I drop the file "SmallSampleDataSet.zip" into the landingzone
# Should take about 4 minutes 
And I check for the file "job*.log" every "30" seconds for "300" seconds
Then the landing zone should contain a file with the message "Processed 4148 records"
And the landing zone should contain a file with the message "All records processed successfully."
