Feature: Partial Ingestion Test

Background: I have a landing zone route configured
Given I am using local data store

Scenario: Partial ingestion of data
Given I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "Midgar-Daybreak"
    And I post "PartialIgestionDataSet_Tier0.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
    And the following collections are empty in datastore:
        | collectionName              |
        | student                     |

        | graduationPlan              |
  When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
  And a batch job log has been created
  Then I should see following map of entry counts in the corresponding collections:
        | collectionName              | count |
        | student                     | 78    |
