Feature: Safe Deletion and Cascading Deletion

Background: I have a landing zone route configured
Given I am using local data store

Scenario: Delete Attendance Event with cascade
    Given I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "Midgar-Daybreak"
    And I post "BroadSetOfTypes.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
    And the following collections are empty in datastore:
