Feature: Ingestion Encryption Testing

Background: I have a landing zone route configured
    Given I am using local data store
	And I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone

Scenario: Ingested Student data should be encrypted: Clean Database
	Given I post "encryption.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
	And the following collections are empty in datastore:
        | collectionName              |
        | student                     |   
	When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
	And I am willing to wait upto 60 seconds for ingestion to complete
	And a batch job log has been created
	Then I should see "Processed 1 records." in the resulting batch job file
	 	And I should see following map of entry counts in the corresponding collections:
	        | collectionName              | count |
	        | student                     | 1    |
	    And I find a record in "student" with "body.studentUniqueStateId" equal to "530425896"

Scenario: Ingested Student data should be encrypted: Populated Database
