Feature: Safe Deletion and Cascading Deletion

Background: I have a landing zone route configured
Given I am using local data store

Scenario: Delete Report Card with cascade
    Given I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "Midgar-Daybreak"
    And the following collections are empty in datastore:
       | collectionName                            |

    And I post "BroadReportCardDelete.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
    When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
    And a batch job for file "BroadReportCardDelete.zip" is completed in database
    And a batch job log has been created
	And I should see "records considered for processing: 1" in the resulting batch job file
	And I should see "ingested successfully: 0" in the resulting batch job file
	And I should see "records deleted successfully: 0" in the resulting batch job file
	And I should see "records failed processing: 1" in the resulting batch job file
	And I should see "records not considered for processing: 0" in the resulting batch job file
	And I should see "All records processed successfully." in the resulting batch job file
	And I should see "Processed 1 records." in the resulting batch job file
    And I should not see an error log file created
	And I should not see a warning log file created
